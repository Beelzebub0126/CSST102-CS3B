INTRODUCTION

Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows 
computers to learn from data and make decisions without needing 
specific instructions. It is becoming essential in many industries 
because it helps find patterns, make predictions, and automate tasks, 
leading to better and faster results. As more data is available, ML is 
making a bigger difference in areas like healthcare, finance, and 
marketing.

HEALTHCARE

Disease Prediction

Problem Being Solved: One of the most impressive examples of 
machine learning in healthcare is its usage in disease prediction. ML 
can help leverage patient’s health information to find correlations 
between various patient’s symptoms with an assumed disease. These 
correlations can help forecast possible health outcomes before any 
health conditions occur and give doctors an understanding of 
underlying patterns of disease.

Type of Machine Learning Used: Supervised learning is often 
employed in disease prediction models, where patient data labeled 
with specific health outcomes is used to train the model to predict the 
likelihood of diseases in patients.

Impact of the Solution: Predicting diabetes, liver disease, and cancer 
at an early stage of development will probably mean that the greatest 
shift may be found in preventive medicine. A good example here 
is IBM Watson Genomics that combines cognitive computing with 
genome-based tumor sequencing to speed up the correct diagnoses 
of cancer.

FINANCE

Fraud Detection

Problem Being Solved: Fraud prevention is another area where AI 
can play a role. Security teams use machine learning algorithms to 
analyze millions of data points and detect fraud as it’s happening, as 
well as prevent it before funds are released from a client’s account. 
This is possible with large neural networks called deep learning, in this 
case fueled by massive amounts of financial data. A fraud prevention 
system can look at patterns in incoming transactions and compare 
them to previous data to determine if something looks odd or 
suspicious, such as many small transactions.

Type of Machine Learning Used: Deep learning, a type of 
Supervised learning, is used to analyze vast amount of financial data 
to detect and prevent fraudulent activities.

Impact of the Solution: A fraud prevention system can helps tackle 
false positives, or false declines, which can happen when an algorithm 
flags a transaction as suspicious, but there is no actual fraud. With 
validation and back testing, a fraud prevention system can become 
more accurate over time, flagging real fraudulent transactions before 
they occur.

MARKETING

Predictive Recommendation

Problem Being Solved: Recommender systems can be used to 
surface information that a user may enjoy. For example, if you wanted 
to find out what movies to watch based on your preferences, or what 
music to listen to next based on the type of mood you’re in, 
recommender systems can be very useful.

Type of Machine Learning Used: Supervised learning is used to 
analyze users viewing history and make personalized 
recommendations for better user experience.

Impact of the Solution: Netflix uses machine learning to predict 
what you'll want to watch next. If you start watching a movie and get 
bored, Netflix’s AI system will recommend another movie for you. It 
uses historical data on users' viewing behaviors to make these 
recommendations. For example, if you watched The Hunger Games, it 
might recommend Squid Game next. As The Motley Fool reports, 
Netflix’s recommender engine is said to save the firm $1 billion a year 
through decreased churn and higher retention. In other words, AI is a 
game-changer for Netflix, and a big part of why they're in the coveted 
FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) group.

CONCLUSION

Disease Prediction (Healthcare): ML helps doctors predict diseases 
like cancer or diabetes early by analyzing patient data, leading to 
better treatment and prevention.

Fraud Detection (Finance): ML identifies and prevents fraud by 
spotting unusual patterns in financial transactions, making banking 
more secure.

Predictive Recommendation (Marketing): ML recommends 
products or content based on what people like, improving user 
experience and helping companies like Netflix keep customers.
